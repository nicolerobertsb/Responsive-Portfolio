            <p>My name is Nicole Roberts and I was born in El Centro, California in May of the year 1994. I was born to
                a Mexican father and a half German/half Norweigan mother.

                <p>I grew up in a town called Mexicali in Baja California, Mexico. My first language was Spanish,
                    however, I quickly learned English and grew up speaking both languages at home.
                    When I was 17 I wanted to transfer to a school in the United States so that I would be able to go to
                    Med School in the states. I moved to Seattle in 2013 to pursue a degree in Marine & Conservational
                    Biology.</p>

                <p>In June of 2018 I quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Europe, never planning on coming back. I
                    travelled to 11 countries and stayed a total of 4 months abroad. I came back in October of the same
                    year and started working at Zulily as an Assistant Buyer.
                    I am now pursuing further education in Software Engineering to be able to one day create software
                    that will program buildings to be 100% self sustainable.</p>
